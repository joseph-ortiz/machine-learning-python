Learning machine learning with python

##What is Machine Learning
- Data gets passed to algorithm and analyzes the data to create a model
## Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised - Given a set of training data, the algorithm analyzes that data and createsa  model to predict a value. 
 - Value Prediction
 - Needs training data containg value being predicted
 - Trains model predcits value in new data
 - For example, predicting a price of the house based off of a data set of existing house attributes such as rooms, location, square feet.
- Unsupervised - Looking at cluster of like data with similar traits, classifies data to a model to predict a value. 
 - Identiy cluster of like data
 - Data does not contain cluster membership.
 - Model proives access to data by cluster. 
 - For example, determining pitch of a voice to determine a particular voice.

##Why?
Data Science is a blend of Software development and Math/Statistics

##Tools

##Machine Learning Workflow
- An orchestrated and *repeatable pattern* which systematically transforms and processes information to create predictive solutions.
- Steps
 - Asking the right question
 - Preparing the Data
 - selecting the algorithm
 - Training the model
 - Testing the model
- Guidelines
 - Early steps are most important
 - Expect to go backwards 
  - later knowledge effects previous steps
- Data is never as you need it
 - Data will have to be altered
- More data is better
 - Better results
- Don't purse a bad solution
 - reevaluate, fix or quit
