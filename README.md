Learning machine learning with python

##What is Machine Learning
- Data gets passed to algorithm and analyzes the data to create a model
## Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised - Given a set of training data, the algorithm analyzes that data and createsa  model to predict a value. 
 - Value Prediction
 - Needs training data containg value being predicted
 - Trains model predcits value in new data
 - For example, predicting a price of the house based off of a data set of existing house attributes such as rooms, location, square feet.
- Unsupervised - Looking at cluster of like data with similar traits, classifies data to a model to predict a value. 
 - Identiy cluster of like data
 - Data does not contain cluster membership.
 - Model proives access to data by cluster. 
 - For example, determining pitch of a voice to determine a particular voice.
